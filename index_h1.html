            Hello, my name is Josiah Small. I am from the North Myrtle beach area. I am 21 years old.
            I am a senior computer science major this is my third year in this major. 
            I decided to change my major because I was more interested in technology.
            I have two siblings, an older sister and a younger brother, and my mother and father.
            I choose to come to NCAT because of the culture and the history of the university, I am still glad that I made the right choice in attending an HBCU.
            My hobbies are hanging out with my friends and watching movies. I also like to travel as well.
            I am excited about this course, and this is my first HTML assignment.
            I am hoping I can take what I learn in this course and apply it o my other coding classes.
            I am striving this year to get an internship for the summer.
            My dream jobs are becoming a software engineer or working in cyber security. Hopefully, I can learn more about these throughout the course this semester.
