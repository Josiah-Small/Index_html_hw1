As the little prince dropped off to sleep, 
I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<span class="Underline"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>

<span class="Highlight"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>

In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:

<span class="Bold_Red">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>

As his lips opened slightly with suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:

<spam class="Bold_Red_2">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--
the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep. . .</spam>

And I felt him to be more fragile still. 

<span class="Underline_2"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</span>
